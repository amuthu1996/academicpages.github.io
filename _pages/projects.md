* **Transformation of Facial Expression**<br>
  <i class="fa fa-clock-o" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 5px;"></i> _July 2017 - May 2018_
    * Developed Neural Network architecture inspired from CycleGAN to transform emotion of face in an image. e.g smiling to crying
    * Transformed Images with 70% pixel-to-pixel accuracy using Python, OpenCV and Tensorflow

* **Sketches to Pokemon Faces**<br>
  <i class="fa fa-clock-o" aria-hidden="true" style="margin-right: 5px;"></i>Dec 2016 - Apr 2017
    * Developed a Neural Network to generate images of pokemon faces from its rough sketches
    * Engineered Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) with Tensorflow, Python
    * Awarded 3rd prize at Technology and Innovative Project (TIP) day among 100+ projects
