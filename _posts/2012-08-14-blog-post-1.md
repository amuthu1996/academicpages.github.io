# 5. Pose Net
We worked on the architecture proposed in the paper Relative Camera Pose Estimation Using CNN [https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01381]. The relative camera pose is $\Delta P$ can be divided into two separate components i.e Translation ($\Delta T$) and Rotation ($\Delta R$). The Translation is a relative position vector $\Delta T$ (3-dimensional quantity) and  Rotation is relative orientation vector $\Delta R$ (4-dimensional quaternion).

## 5.1 Architecture

The model involves extracting features from the images using convolutional layers and followed by fully-connected layers. The network is obtained by removing the last three fully-connected layers layers (FC6, FC7 and FC8) from the original Hybrid-CNN preserving only convolutional, max-pooling layers
and ReLU. The Hybrid-CNN is a AlexNet fine tuned on Places Dataset. The architecture is shown below. Both the branches share weights.


The output of the final convolutional layer is of the shape 13x13x128. We pass two frames through the network and obtain their representations.

Then we merge both the representations and get 13x13x256 vector. The regression part in turn is composed of two fully-connected (FC1 and FC2) layers, where FC1 and FC2 have 4 and 3 connections respectively for estimating the 7-dimensional pose vector.

The loss function is given below:

$ L  = || $ $\Delta T - \Delta \hat{T} $ $ || $ $ + \beta *  $ $||$ \Delta Q - \Delta \hat{Q}$ $||$
